/**
 * Regression: when native-profiler-stop has populated `exportedFiles.cpu` with
 * a path but the file is unreadable (deleted, FS error, /tmp cleanup), the
 * pipeline used to silently swallow the ENOENT inside parseCpuFile and
 * return empty data, and the analyze tool would render an "All clear"
 * report — pretending the trace was successfully analyzed when the data
 * was never read.
 *
 * The analyze tool must distinguish ENOENT/EACCES from "file exists but
 * has no findings" and surface the export failure via `exportErrors`.
