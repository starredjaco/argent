/**
 * One platform branch of a cross-platform tool: its host-binary dependencies

 *
 * Co-locating `requires` with `handler` keeps each platform file self-contained
 * — when you read `platforms/ios.ts` you see exactly what binaries it shells
 * out to, not a global declaration two levels up. `dispatchByPlatform` wires
 * the right branch's `requires` into the preflight before the handler runs,
 * so an iOS-only environment never trips an `adb` check, and vice versa.
 *
 * Use the `ToolDefinition.requires` field instead when a binary is needed by
 * *every* invocation regardless of which platform branch fires (rare — usually
 * only true for analysis / no-device tools).
