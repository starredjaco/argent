 * Distinct from `UnsupportedOperationError`:
 *   - UnsupportedOperationError: capability says no, this device class is not
 *     a target for the tool (e.g. pinch on Android — adb has no multi-touch).
 *   - NotImplementedOnPlatformError: capability *could* say yes once filled
 *     in; the work just hasn't happened. The agent should report this back
 *     to the user verbatim instead of retrying.
 *
 * The HTTP dispatcher maps this to `501 Not Implemented` and surfaces the
 * `hint` field so the agent (and contributor) can see exactly what to wire.
 *
 * Usage in a stub at `tools/<your-tool>/platforms/<platform>.ts`:
 *
 *   throw new NotImplementedOnPlatformError({
 *     toolId: "<your-tool>",
 *     platform: "android",
 *     hint: "Optional one-line nudge — e.g. which adb / xcrun command to wrap.",
