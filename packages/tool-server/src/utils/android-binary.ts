/**
 * Resolve an Android SDK binary to an absolute path.
 *
 * Lookup order — matches what Android Studio, react-native CLI, and the
 * `avdmanager`/`sdkmanager` wrappers do, in this priority:
 *   1. `command -v <name>` (PATH)
 *   2. `$ANDROID_HOME/<subdir>/<name>` if executable
 *   3. `$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/<subdir>/<name>` if executable
 *
 * Returns `null` if none of those resolve. Callers that surface the failure
 * to users should funnel through `ensureDep` so the missing-binary message
 * names the install hint instead of producing a downstream "no AVDs"-style
 * symptom.
 *
 * Argent previously called `execFile("emulator", ...)` and `execFile("adb",
 * ...)` directly, which only honors PATH. Users with a working SDK install
 * but `$ANDROID_HOME/emulator` not on PATH (the default state on macOS after
 * an Android Studio install — Studio sets ANDROID_HOME but leaves PATH
 * alone) saw `listAvds()` silently return `[]`, which `boot-device` then
 * mis-reported as "no AVDs". This resolver closes that gap.
