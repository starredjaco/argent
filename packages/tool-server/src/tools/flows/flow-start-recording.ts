Use when you want to capture a reusable sequence of device interactions for later replay.
Returns { message, flowFile } and optionally { previousFlow } if a prior recording was abandoned.
Fails if the .argent/flows/ directory cannot be created or the flow file cannot be written.

After starting, use flow-add-step to append tool calls — each step is executed
LIVE so you can verify it works before it gets recorded. Use flow-add-echo
to add labels. Call flow-finish-recording when done.

If a recorded step turns out to be wrong, you can edit the .yaml file directly
to remove or reorder steps.`,
