Use when you need to verify native devtools readiness before calling native-full-hierarchy, native-describe-screen, or native-network-logs.

Returns { envSetup, appRunning, connected, requiresRestart, nextLaunchWillBeInjected }:
- envSetup: DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES is configured in the simulator's launchd environment
- appRunning: the target bundle currently has a running UIKit process on the simulator
- connected: the dylib is active in the current running process for this bundleId
- requiresRestart: the app is already running but its current process does not have native devtools injected
- nextLaunchWillBeInjected: if you launch this bundle now, native devtools env setup is already in place

Call this before using app-scoped native hierarchy tools or native-network-logs.
If appRunning is false and nextLaunchWillBeInjected is true: use launch-app normally.
If requiresRestart is true: call restart-app, then proceed with the native feature.
Fails if the simulator server is not running for the given UDID or the bundleId is not found.`,
