**[Argent](https://argent.swmansion.com)** is an **agentic toolkit** that gives your AI assistant direct access to iOS Simulators and Android Emulators. Ask it to tap a button, run a profiler or reproduce an issue manually - all from within your CLI, without switching context.

```bash
npx @swmansion/argent init
```

## Capabilities

- **Autonomous iOS and Android development** - Allow your agent to work with iOS and Android apps on its own - let it build, open, interact with the app and debug it. Ask for reproducing issues, testing features manually, profiling your app and much more, without ever interrupting your work.
- **UI interaction** - Give your agent full control toolkit - tapping, swiping, pinching, typing, gestures, hardware buttons and all other gears included. Let it navigate your app exactly as a user would, without lifting a finger.
- **Profiling with batteries included** - Argent can perform and analyze both React-Native and Xcode Instruments profiling sessions. Get comprehensive summaries and ask to optimise your app where you find fit.
- **Debugging and diagnostics** - Let your agent inspect logs, capture crash reports, and reproduce failing states on the simulator, so you can jump straight to the fix.
- **React Native out of the box** - Argent works with React Native apps natively, so your agent can build, launch, and iterate on your RN project the same way it would any native app - no extra setup required.

> **Tip:** Once installed, ask your assistant _"What can Argent do?"_ - it will walk you through all capabilities available.

## Installation

#### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18** or later
- For iOS: macOS with **Xcode** installed
- For Android: **Android SDK Platform Tools** (`adb`) on `PATH`, and the **Android Emulator** package if you want to boot AVDs from Argent. Create AVDs via Android Studio or `avdmanager`.

#### Run `init` in your project

From your project root:

```bash
npx @swmansion/argent init
```

This command triggers an installation wizard which:

- Installs `@swmansion/argent` globally
- Detects your editor and registers the MCP server
- Copies skills, rules, and agent definitions into your workspace

#### Prefer a manual install?

```bash
npm install -g @swmansion/argent
argent init
```

## Privacy

Argent does not collect or transmit any user data.
No telemetry, no analytics, no crash reporting.

- Argent integrates with your agent locally over MCP stdio.
- Its internal tools are not reachable from outside your machine.
- The only outbound network call we make is the version check against our public npm package, which sends no user data and fails gracefully if blocked.
